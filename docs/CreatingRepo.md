# Creating a Repository

This is instructions on how to create an ontology repository in
GitHub. This will only need to be done once per project. You may need
assistance from someone with basic unix knowledge in following
instructions here.

We will walk you though the steps to make a new ontology project

## 1. Install requirements

 * [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker): Install Docker and make sure its runnning properly, for example by typing `docker ps` in your terminal or command line (CMD). If all is ok, you should be seeing something like: 

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

 * git, for example bundled with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## 2. Download the wrapper script and pull latest ODK version

 * Linux/Mac: [seed-via-docker.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/master/seed-via-docker.sh)
 * PC: [seed-via-docker.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/master/seed-via-docker.bat)
 * You should have git installed - for the repo command to work perfectly, it requires a `.gitconfig` file in your user directory!
 * First, make sure you have Docker running (you will see the Docker whale in your toolbar on a Mac)
 * To make sure you have the latest version of the ODK installed, run in the command line 

    `docker pull obolibrary/odkfull`

**NOTE** The very first time you run this it may be slow, while docker downloads necessary images. Don't worry, subsequent runs should be much faster!

**NOTE** Windows users, occasionally it has been reported that files downloaded on a Windows machine get a wrong file ending, for example `seed-via-docker.bat.txt` instead of `seed-via-docker.bat`, or, as we will see later, `project.yaml.txt` instead of `project.yaml`. If you have problems, double check your files are named correctly after the download!

## 3. Run the wrapper script

You can either pass in a configuration file in YAML format that specifies your ontology project setup, or you can pass arguments on the command line.

### Unix (Max, Linux)

Passing arguments on the command line:

    ./seed-via-docker.sh -d po -d ro -d pato -u cmungall -t "Triffid Behavior ontology" triffo

Using a the predefined [project.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/master/examples/triffo/project.yaml) file:

    ./seed-via-docker.sh -C examples/triffo/project.yaml

### Windows

Passing arguments on the command line:

    seed-via-docker.bat -d po -d ro -d pato -u cmungall -t "Triffid Behavior ontology" triffo

Using a the predefined [project.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/master/examples/triffo/project.yaml) config file:

    seed-via-docker.bat -C project.yaml

You can add a -c (lowercase) just before the -C (capital c) in the command to first delete any previous attempt to generate your ontology with the ODK, and then replaces it with a completely new one. So, `-c` stands for `clean` or "clean up previous attempts before running again" and `-C` stands for "the next parameter is the relative path to my config file".

In general, we now _always_ recommend the use of config files. The ODK has a rich set of configuration options, most of which can only be set through the config file, but in general the config also serves as documentation and will help with updating your ontology at later stages. To create a config file, you can download for example [project.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/master/examples/triffo/project.yaml) by clicking on the link and then typing `command+s` on Mac or `ctrl+s` on Windows to save it in the same directory as your `seed-via-docker` script. Then you can open the file with a text editor like Notepad++, Atom, Sublime or even nano, and adapt it to your project. Other more comprehensive examples can be found [here](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/tree/master/configs).

This will create your starter files in
`target/triffid-behavior-ontology`. It will also prepare an initial
release and initialize a local repository (not yet pushed to your Git host site such as GitHub or GitLab).

### Problems?

There are two frequently encountered problems at this stage:

#### No `.gitconfig` in user directory.

The seed-via-docker script requires a `.gitconfig` file in your user directory. If your `.gitconfig` is in a different directory, you need to change the path in the downloaded `seed-via-docker` script. For example on Windows (look at `seed-via-docker.bat`):

```
docker run -v %userprofile%/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig -v %cd%:/work -w /work --rm -ti obolibrary/odkfull /tools/odk.py seed %*
```

`%userprofile%/.gitconfig` should be changed to the correct path of your local `.gitconfig` file.

#### Spaces is user path

We have had reports of users having trouble if there paths (say, `D:\data`) contain a space symbol, like `D:/Dropbox (Personal)` or similar. In this case, we recommend to find a directory you can work in that does not contain a space symbol.

You can customize at this stage, but we recommend to first push the changes to you Git hosting site (see next steps).

## 4. Push to Git hosting website

The development kit will automatically initialize a git project, add all files and commit.

You will need to create a project on you Git hosting site.

*For GitHub:*

 1. Go to: https://github.com/new
 2. The owner MUST be the org you selected with the `-u` option. The name MUST be the one you set with `-t`.
 3. Do not initialize with a README (you already have one)
 4. Click Create
 5. See the section under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line"

*For GitLab:*

 1. Go to: https://gitlab.com/projects/new
 2. The owner MUST be the org you selected with the `-u` option. The name MUST be the one you set with `-t`.
 3. Do not initialize with a README (you already have one)
 4. Click 'Create project'
 5. See the section under "Push an existing Git repository"

Follow the instructions there. E.g.

```
cd target/triffid-behavior-ontology
git remote add origin git@github.com:cmungall/triffid-behavior-ontology.git
git push -u origin master
```

Note: you can now mv `target/triffid-behavior-ontology` to anywhere you like in your home directory. Or you can do a fresh checkout from github.


## Next Steps: Edit and release cycle

In your repo you will see a README-editors.md file that has been customized for your project. Follow these instructions.

Generally the cycle is to:

 - branch
 - edit the edit.owl file
 - make test
 - git commit
 - git push

To make a release:

`make prepare_release`

Note that any make step can be preceded by run.sh if you have Docker installed:

`sh run.sh make prepare_release`

## OBO Library metadata

The assumption here is that you are ahdering to OBO principles and
want to eventually submit to OBO. Your repo will contain stub metadata
files to help you do this.

You can create pull requests for your ontology on the OBO Foundry. See the `src/metadata` file for more details.

For more documentation, see http://obofoundry.org

## Additional

You will want to also:

 * enable travis
 * enable zenodo (optional)

See the README-editors.md file that has been generated for your project.
