Ontology Development Kit Guide
============

This guide is intended for editors of all OBO ontologies.

**NOTE** this guide is adapted from the GO editors guide. Some
instructions may be too GO-specific.

The guide weaves together day to day editing with Protege as well as
use of ROBOT and other parts of the ODK
