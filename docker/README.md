# Dockerfiles for obolibrary/osk{full,lite}

This folder containers Dockerfiles for building the images here:

https://hub.docker.com/r/obolibrary/

We make two: osklite and oskfull. See individual folders for details

Note that these containers are not intended to be built as part of the
ontology generation process. They are here for obo admins to make and
release the docker images required for osk to work.
