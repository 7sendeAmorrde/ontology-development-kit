# Requesting new terms

Before you write a new request, please consider the following: 

- **Does the term already exist?** Before submitting suggestions for new ontology terms, check whether the term exist, either as a primary term or a synonym term. You can search using [OLS](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/{{ project.id }})

## How to add a new term

### Request a new term _via_ the GitHub [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/{{ project.owner }}/{{ project.repo }}/issues/)

1. **Write a detailed request:** Please be specific and include as many details as necessary, providing background information, and if possible, suggesting a solution. The editors of {{ project.title }} will be better equipped to address your suggestions if you offer details regarding *'what is wrong'*, *'why'*, and *'how to fix it'*.
2. **Provide examples and references:** Please include PMIDs for new term requests, and include also screenshots, or URLs illustrating the current ontology structure for other types of requests.
3. **For new term request:** Be sure to provide suggestions for label (name), definition, references, position in hierarchy, etc.
4. **For updates to relationships:** Provide details of the current axioms, why you think they are wrong or not sufficient, and what exactly should be added or removed.

## Add a new term by directly editing the ontology
